# LIBRARY SETTINGS
#
# You can specify the full pathname of the library,
# or use the `-LLIBDIR' flag during linking and do
# at least one of the following:
#
#   * add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable during execution
#   * add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable during linking
#   * use the `-Wl,--rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
#   * have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'
#
# We include all of them we use in all the settings we've encountered;
# you may want to tune this for your particular system or need.
#
# From http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/notes/rpath.html
#
# Here's a brief primer on the way that this works on Solaris and Linux. 
# The search paths for libraries come from three sources:
#
#   * the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (if set)
#   * any rpath encoded in the binary (more on this later)
#   * the system default search paths.
#
# The sources are searched in this order, and the first matching library is used.
#
# From http://www.netbsd.org/docs/pkgsrc/configuring.html
#
# If you want to pass flags to the linker, both in the configure step and the build step,
# you can do this in two ways: either set LDFLAGS or LIBS. The difference between the two
# is that LIBS will be appended to the command line, while LDFLAGS come earlier.
